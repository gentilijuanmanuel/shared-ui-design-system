# shared-ui-design-system 🎨

A Swift Package to encapsulate and centralize custom controls, helpers, extensions, and anything related to UI that can be shared across apps.

I have two long-term ideas here:

- 🧘‍♂️ Keep it as generic as possible. I don't want to introduce specificity related to a particular app or product.
- 📜 Extensively document it, using [DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/).

*Note*: for now, its content is exclusively about `SwiftUI`, but it can include enhancements or extensions on top of `UIKit`.

Feel free to pick some code or use the package directly in your app if you find it useful!
